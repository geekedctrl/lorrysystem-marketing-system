## Project Goal
Evolve the existing product; Milestone B delivers mock campaign strategy from qualified evidence-backed prospects to saved proposals and human review.

## Repository State
Application https://github.com/geekedctrl/lorrysystem-marketing-system — codex/campaign-strategist, base9c0a3b0f03306d399ba9ee76ab14a8be37e7ed09. Initial knowledge checkpoint9540786. Implementation currently uncommitted and about to be checkpointed; run git status --short and git rev-parse HEAD.
Deployment https://github.com/geekedctrl/lorrysystem-deploy — main,cba785acbb4da43a135da4a6bc06d1bfb94cda40 inspected through API; no modifications.

## Current Milestone
B — mock Campaign Strategist; feature code and local verification complete, PR/remote CI pending.

## Current Task
B-04, lead, IN_PROGRESS: checkpoint and PR to develop.

## Completed Work
Three bounded audits, shared vendor-neutral docs, API/migration015 and dashboard review UX.13 offline tests,27 PostgreSQL checks,62 actual HTTP/dashboard checks,8 focused dashboard tests. Existing workspace183 checks, research, pipeline, quality, automation, n8n70, presentation8 and UX5 passed. See TEST_STATUS.md.

## Incomplete Work
Push implementation and open PR; remote CI results. Live providers, creative generation, global budget ledger, multichannel conversion, CRM and video are later milestones. Contact verification metadata and browser viewport visual QA remain limitations.

## Changed Files
api/app auth/router/model/schema/service registrations; api/scripts campaign suites and workspace RLS count; database/migrations/versions/015_campaign_proposals.py; dashboard/app routes, workspace roles, templates and portable import temp path; dashboard/scripts/validate_campaign_proposals.py; .github/workflows/ci.yml; README.md; docs/campaign-strategist.md; AGENTS.md and docs/ai.

## Architecture Decisions
DECISIONS.md ADR001–004. Proposal review is not outbound action approval. Mock provider constrained in DB. Unknown future asset cost is null; generation cost0 is known. Context/optimistic versions guard review and edits.

## Test Results
TEST_STATUS.md gives commands/environment/caveats. WindowsPython3.14 venv, PostgreSQL17 disposable container lorry-campaign-test-8882 at localhost55432/campaign_test, API8012/dashboard8092. No existing data volumes. Synthetic-only tests. No actual search/model/send.

## Blockers
No local implementation blocker. Git shared metadata requires sandbox escalation. Remote CI not executed yet. USD50 total monthly policy is not implemented; live paid adapters must wait for cost controls and authorization.

## Next Steps
1. Commit reviewed implementation, push codex/campaign-strategist and create PR targeting develop.
2. Record PR and remote CI result; stop task-owned local services/container after testing.
3. Review/merge only with user authorization; then plan milestone C mock asset lifecycle and budget reservations.

## Safety Notes
No merging, DEV/PROD deployment, real prospect contact, paid provider calls, account credentials or infrastructure changes authorized. Feature branch does not trigger DEV deployment. Free-form copy remains an unverified human-reviewed suggestion; social affiliation remains hypothesis. Migration downgrade drops proposal history, requiring backup/export.

## Handoff Readiness
PARTIAL — verified code local; remote checkpoint/PR pending.
